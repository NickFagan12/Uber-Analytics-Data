# üöó Uber Data Analytics Project

## üìä Project Overview
This project explores and visualizes Uber ride data to uncover key insights about ride patterns, customer behavior, driver performance, and payment trends. The goal is to use data analytics and visualization techniques to improve operational efficiency and understand factors influencing customer satisfaction.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from **[Kaggle: Uber Data Analytics Dataset]**, and it was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using **Tableau Public** and **SQL**.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation
Data preparation was performed in **Tableau Prep Builder** and **Excel**, with key steps including:

1. **Removing duplicates** and irrelevant columns.  
2. **Replacing null values** with meaningful labels (e.g., `N/A` or `0`).  
3. **Standardizing payment methods** (e.g., combining ‚ÄúCredit Card‚Äù and ‚ÄúDebit Card‚Äù categories).  
4. **Creating calculated fields** for better insights:
   - `Total Cancelled Rides`
   - `Customer Satisfaction Index`
   - `Driver Performance Score`
   - `Revenue per Ride`

## üìà Tableau Dashboards
All dashboards were built in **Tableau Desktop Public Edition**, focusing on actionable business insights.

###1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Rides and Booking Value Overview
- **Purpose:** Analyze overall ride volume and total booking values by payment method.
- **Key Insight:** UPI and Cash payments dominate the transaction volume, suggesting user preference for fast, direct payments.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Satisfaction Dashboard
- **Purpose:** Compare customer ratings and cancellation patterns.
- **Key Insight:** Higher cancellation rates correlate with lower customer satisfaction scores.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Driver Performance Dashboard
- **Purpose:** Visualize driver ratings vs. cancelled rides to assess reliability.
- **Key Insight:** Most cancellations stem from a small subset of drivers with lower ratings.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue and Payment Analysis
- **Purpose:** Examine booking value and revenue trends across payment types.
- **Key Insight:** Credit/Debit card users tend to have higher booking values per ride.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Metrics
- **Purpose:** Evaluate metrics like CTAT (Customer Time at Arrival) and VTAT (Vehicle Time at Arrival).
- **Key Insight:** Reducing VTAT can improve overall customer satisfaction and repeat bookings.

## üß† Key Insights & Findings
- **Driver reliability** strongly impacts overall platform ratings.  
- **Cancellation patterns** reveal operational inefficiencies during peak hours.  
- **Digital payment adoption** is increasing, particularly through UPI.  
- **Short-distance rides** show higher frequency but lower revenue contribution.  
- **Customer ratings** are influenced by both time-to-pickup and fare accuracy.
